# ISLR-Python

This repo contains my solutions to the Labs from the text [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) in Python. The labs are done using Jupyter Notebook. 
I have also included my interpretation of the results obtained and made note of concepts that were confusing for me so that I can refer to it when needed. 

I started this as a hobby project to strengthen my basics and stay familiar with Python data manipulation, I highly recommend working through these exercises to anyone looking to deepen their knowledge of fundamentals of statistics.   
I hope you will also find this useful and happy learning!
